    <section class="section bg-teal-50">

        <h2 class="heading-section mb-8 text-center">The Vision: A Perpetual Hallway Track</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          You know that feeling at Agile conferences and Open Spaces — the one you get during the hallway conversations, not the scheduled sessions?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          That moment when you're talking with someone who <em>gets it</em>. The ideas flow. You feel seen. You remember why you fell in love with this work in the first place.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          Then the conference ends. Everyone goes home. And slowly, that spark fades back into the daily grind.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-teal-950 font-semibold mb-8">
          This community exists to keep that spark alive.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          After the Agile conference in Denver, many of us found ourselves asking the same question: <em>How do we hold onto this?</em> The Agile Alliance's absorption into PMI left a lot of people uncertain about the future. At meetups and Open Spaces — Seattle Code Crafters, Agile Open Northwest — the conversation kept coming back to the same thing:
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 italic mb-8">
          How do we preserve the magic of what Agile and XP were built on?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          I've been here before. In 2015, I helped build Legacy Code Rocks — an online community that sprang from the same desire to maintain connection between conferences. It's still going strong a decade later.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          But Legacy Code Rocks serves a narrow audience. This is something broader.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-teal-950 font-semibold mb-6">
          Because here's what I've come to believe: at the heart of every Agile practice is communication.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          It's the unstated undercurrent in the foundational books. It's what separates emergent effectiveness from certification-stamp culture. It's what makes the hallway track magic possible.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          That belief is at the core of everything I do with <strong>Debugging Human Communication</strong> — my coaching program for people in technical contexts. And now I'm opening the community side of the program to a small group of founding members.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900">
          This community is for people who feel that in their bones — whether you're a developer, an Agile coach, a product manager, a test engineer, or a thought leader who's helped thousands of technologists find their voice. You don't need to write code to belong here. You need to care about the humans in technical systems.

        <p class="text-xl text-teal-950 font-semibold mb-6">
          A founding member community — not a product launch.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          The first people in any community shape its culture. That's why this isn't open to everyone. The people being invited right now are hand-selected by champions I trust deeply — people who, when I see them at a conference, feel like a family reunion.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          As a founding member, you'll help shape what this becomes. You'll have:

          <strong>The common thread:</strong> You believe communication is at the heart of effective collaboration in technical environments. And you want to stay connected to people who feel the same way.
