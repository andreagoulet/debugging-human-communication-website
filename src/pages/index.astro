        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          You're in a meeting, explaining why the architecture decision matters, and you can see eyes glazing over. You're not wrong—you're just lost in implementation details when they wanted to hear about impact.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          Or you're at a conference, coffee in hand, scanning the room. Everyone else seems to be connecting effortlessly. You're calculating the least awkward time to leave.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-8">
          Or you're preparing for a 1:1 with your skip-level manager. You have ideas. Ambitions. But when they ask "what do you want?", your mind goes blank.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-950 font-medium mb-6">Sound familiar? Maybe it's one of these:</p>

          You've read books. Watched TED talks. Maybe sat through a corporate training where you role-played with strangers.

        <p class="text-xl text-teal-950 font-semibold mb-6">You weren't taught communication as a learnable skill.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          That's the gap. Not some personality defect. Not a lack of empathy. Not being "too logical."
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          You learned to code. You learned system design. You learned to debug problems by tracing them to root causes.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          But communication? That was supposed to just... happen. Osmosis. Watching how other people do it. Picking up on unwritten rules nobody explained.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          Some people did pick it up. You've watched them navigate politics, build relationships, get promoted.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-teal-950 font-medium italic">
          And you've quietly wondered: What do they know that I don't?
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- The Answer -->
    <section class="py-20 px-6 bg-white">
      <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-teal-950 mb-8">The Answer</h2>

        <p class="text-2xl text-teal-800 font-bold mb-8">
          Communication is a system. It can be analyzed, understood, and systematically improved.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          When a conversation goes wrong, there's a reason. And like any system, you can form a hypothesis, test an approach, and iterate based on what you learn.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900 mb-6">
          That's how you already work. You don't expect code to be perfect on the first try. You ship, observe, adjust.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-900">
          Debugging Human Communication applies that same experimental mindset to conversations. Try something. See what happens. Refine your approach. Get better over time—not through abstract theory, but through real practice with real feedback.

              I didn't stumble into communication late in my career—I've been obsessed with it for 25 years. As a kid, social situations baffled me. Then I discovered linguistics, business communication, and copywriting, and I saw that human interaction has patterns, structures, even computational principles. It's not magic. It's a system.

            <p class="text-lg text-teal-900">
              Those programs were probably designed for everyone. This one is designed for <em>you</em>—someone who thinks in systems, values evidence, and wants frameworks they can apply consistently. The methodology matches how your brain already works.

            <p class="text-lg text-teal-900">
              This isn't additional work. It's a different approach to conversations you're already having. The time you spend stewing over an email, replaying a meeting, or avoiding a difficult conversation—that's the time this reclaims.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-teal-950 mb-3">"Is it worth the investment?"</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-teal-900">
              Consider the cost of staying stuck. Missed promotions. Stalled projects because you couldn't get buy-in. Relationships damaged by miscommunication. One successful difficult conversation can change your career trajectory. Soumya got 7 headcount during a freeze. What would that kind of result be worth to you?

          You could keep doing what you've been doing. Replay conversations. Wonder why your ideas don't land. Calculate the least awkward time to leave.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-teal-100 mb-6">
          Or you could approach communication the way you approach any system: learn how it works, practice deliberately, improve systematically.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-teal-200 font-medium mb-8">
          The conversations you're avoiding aren't going away. The stakeholders you need to influence are still waiting. The career ceiling you've hit is still there.
        </p>

        <p class="text-2xl text-white font-bold mb-8">But it doesn't have to be.</p>
