## What This Is

You care about the humans in technical systems. Not just the code, not just the architecture — the people. This community is for others who feel the same way.

I run a coaching program called **Debugging Human Communication** for people in technical contexts — community, group coaching, and private coaching. Right now, I'm inviting a small group of founding members into the community side. You're one of them.

## The Exchange

Normally, community access costs $129. As a founding member, you're not paying that.

But you're not getting it for nothing either. The first people in any community shape its culture. That's what I'm asking: show up, participate, model the behaviors that make spaces feel safe. If that sounds like work you'd do anyway, you're exactly who I'm looking for.

As a founding member, you'll have:

- **Access to the online community on Heartbeat** — ongoing conversation, questions, and connection
- **A Discovery Session with me** — a 30-minute 1:1 where we dig into a real challenge you're facing. It's my thank you for helping shape what this becomes.
- **The opportunity to influence the culture** from day one

## Who This Is For

People embedded in technical contexts who believe communication is at the heart of effective collaboration. Developers, coaches, product managers, test engineers, thought leaders — or anyone who feels at home in spaces where deep technical conversations happen.

You don't need to write code. You don't need to be an Agile enthusiast. You just need to care about the humans in technical systems.

## Why I'm Building This

At the Agile conference in Denver, there was a Hack for Good session. A room full of developers, stakeholders from a nonprofit focused on eradicating child abuse and neglect, and a shared mission: build something real, together, in a few days.

And we did. Using AI, using Agile methodologies, we deployed software that genuinely makes a difference in people's lives. I watched collaboration happen the way it's supposed to — communication flowing, technical excellence in service of something that matters, people who'd just met working like they'd known each other for years.

That's Agile at its best. That's what I fell in love with.

Afterward, I caught up with Lada Kesseler and Llewellyn Falco, who had led the development side. We talked about how great it had been — and then the conversation turned bittersweet. *Could we replicate that again?* We'd had moments like this at so many Open Spaces and meetups over the years. But they always ended. Everyone goes home.

A few weeks later, Paige Watson invited me to present at Seattle Code Crafters. I talked about empathy and communication, and the discussion afterward wasn't just about the content — it was about *how do we keep this going?* Not just the infrastructure, but the feeling. The connection.

Then I attended two online conferences through Agile Open Northwest. Same conversations. Same questions. Same longing.

I've been here before. In 2015, I helped build Legacy Code Rocks because technical excellence tracks were being deprioritized at conferences. People who cared about code quality and craft needed a place to keep finding each other — even if the conference circuit wasn't going to provide it. That community is still going strong a decade later.

Now the Agile Alliance has been absorbed into PMI, and I'm watching that same uncertainty spread. *Where do we go? How do we hold onto what made this special?*

This isn't the answer for everyone. But it's one contribution I can make. A place where those of us who've loved Agile conferences, Open Spaces, and hallway track conversations can keep them alive. It felt like a natural extension of the coaching work I've been doing — and honestly, I'm just really excited and grateful to be building it.
