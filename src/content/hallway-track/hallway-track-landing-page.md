## The Vision: A Perpetual Hallway Track

You know that feeling at Agile conferences and Open Spaces — the one you get during the hallway conversations, not the scheduled sessions?

That moment when you're talking with someone who *gets it*. The ideas flow. You feel seen. You remember why you fell in love with this work in the first place.

Then the conference ends. Everyone goes home. And slowly, that spark fades back into the daily grind.

**This community exists to keep that spark alive.**

After the Agile conference in Denver, many of us found ourselves asking the same question: *How do we hold onto this?* The Agile Alliance's absorption into PMI left a lot of people uncertain about the future. At meetups and Open Spaces — Seattle Code Crafters, Agile Open Northwest — the conversation kept coming back to the same thing:

*How do we preserve the magic of what Agile and XP were built on?*

I've been here before. In 2015, I helped build Legacy Code Rocks — an online community that sprang from the same desire to maintain connection between conferences. It's still going strong a decade later.

But Legacy Code Rocks serves a narrow audience. This is something broader.

**Because here's what I've come to believe: at the heart of every Agile practice is communication.** It's the unstated undercurrent in the foundational books. It's what separates emergent effectiveness from certification-stamp culture. It's what makes the hallway track magic possible.

That belief is at the core of everything I do with **Debugging Human Communication** — my coaching program for people in technical contexts. And now I'm opening the community side of the program to a small group of founding members.

This community is for people who feel that in their bones — whether you're a developer, an Agile coach, a product manager, a test engineer, or a thought leader who's helped thousands of technologists find their voice. You don't need to write code to belong here. You need to care about the humans in technical systems.

## What You're Being Invited Into

**A founding member community** — not a product launch.

The first people in any community shape its culture. That's why this isn't open to everyone. The people being invited right now are hand-selected by champions I trust deeply — people who, when I see them at a conference, feel like a family reunion.

As a founding member, you'll help shape what this becomes. You'll have:

- **Access to the online community on Heartbeat** — a space for ongoing conversation, questions, and connection between events
- **An invitation to book a Discovery Session with me** — a condensed version of my private coaching, at no cost
- **The opportunity to influence the culture** from day one

All I ask in return is that you show up and participate. A community only works when people are in it together.

## Who This Is For

This community welcomes people who are embedded in technical contexts — not just those who write code.

**You might be:**
- A software developer who lights up during hallway conversations
- An Agile coach helping teams communicate more effectively
- A product manager bridging technical and business worlds
- A test engineer who sees the human side of quality
- A thought leader, author, or facilitator respected in technical communities
- Someone who doesn't call themselves "technical" but feels at home in spaces where deep technical conversations happen

**The common thread:** You believe communication is at the heart of effective collaboration in technical environments. And you want to stay connected to people who feel the same way.
