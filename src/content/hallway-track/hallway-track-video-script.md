## Script

Hey. I'm Andrea.

If you're watching this, someone I trust thought you should be here. And that means something to me.

I want to tell you about something I'm building — and why I think you might want to be part of it.

**[pause]**

You know that feeling at Agile conferences and Open Spaces? Not during the keynotes or the workshops — but in the hallway. The conversations that happen between sessions. When you bump into someone and suddenly you're deep in a discussion about something you both care about. And for a moment, you feel *seen*. You feel like you're with your people.

That's my favorite part of any conference. The hallway track.

And then it ends. Everyone goes home. And that feeling — that sense of connection — slowly fades. Until the next conference, if there even is one.

**[pause]**

After the Agile conference in Denver, a lot of us were processing some hard news. The Agile Alliance being absorbed into PMI. Uncertainty about what comes next. And at every meetup and Open Space I attended after that — Seattle Code Crafters, Agile Open Northwest — the same question kept surfacing:

*How do we hold onto what made this community special?*

**[pause]**

I've thought about this a lot. Because I've been here before.

Back in 2015, I helped start an online community called Legacy Code Rocks. Same idea — keep the connection alive between conferences. It's still going strong almost a decade later. But it serves a pretty narrow audience.

What I'm building now is broader.

**[pause]**

Here's what I've come to believe: at the heart of every Agile practice is communication. It's the unstated undercurrent running through all the foundational books. It's what separates teams that actually *work* from teams that just follow a process. It's what makes the hallway track magic possible.

That belief is at the core of everything I do with **Debugging Human Communication** — my coaching program for people in technical contexts.

And now I'm opening up the community side of the program to a small group of founding members. My vision is to create a perpetual hallway track — an online space where we can stay connected between events. Where the conversations don't have to end when the conference does.

**[pause]**

But here's the thing about communities: the first people in shape everything that comes after. The culture. The norms. The feeling of the space.

That's why I'm not opening this to everyone. I asked a few people I trust deeply — people who, when I see them at a conference, it feels like a family reunion — to invite people *they* trust.

And that's how you got here.

**[pause]**

If this resonates with you — if you've felt that hallway track magic and wished it didn't have to end — I'd love to have you join us.

All I ask is that you show up and participate. A community only works when people are in it together.

**[warm smile]**

I'll see you inside.

## Production Notes

- Film in a warm, casual setting — not overly produced
- Direct eye contact with camera
- Natural pauses for emphasis (marked with [pause])
- Conversational pace — not rushed
- Consider soft background that suggests "hallway" or informal space
