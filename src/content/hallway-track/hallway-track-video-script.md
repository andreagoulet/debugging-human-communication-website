## Script

Hey. I'm Andrea.

If you're watching this, you care about the humans in technical systems — not just the code, not just the architecture, but the people. Someone I trust saw that in you and thought you should be here.

That means something to me.

**[pause]**

I'm a communication coach, and I recently launched a program called Debugging Human Communication. It's for people in technical contexts who want to get better at the human side of their work.

The program has a few parts — and one of them is a community. That's what you're being invited into as a founding member.

**[pause]**

As a founding member, you'll have access to the online community on Heartbeat — a space for ongoing conversation and connection. And I'm offering you a Discovery Session with me: a 30-minute 1:1 where we dig into a real challenge you're facing. It's my way of saying thank you for helping shape what this becomes.

**[pause]**

Because that's the exchange. The first people in any community set the tone. I'm asking you to show up, participate, and model the kind of space where people feel safe to share. If that sounds like work you'd do anyway — you're exactly who I'm looking for.

**[warm smile]**

I'm really grateful you're here. I'll see you inside.
