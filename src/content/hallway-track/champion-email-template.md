## Email Body

Hey [Name],

I've been thinking about you.

You know how at Agile conferences — or really any gathering of our people — the best part is never the sessions? It's the hallway conversations. Those moments when you're talking with someone who *gets it* and suddenly the ideas are flowing and you remember why you love this work.

And then the conference ends and everyone goes home and... that feeling slowly fades.

**My friend Andrea Goulet is building something to change that.**

She runs a program called **Debugging Human Communication** — communication coaching specifically for people in technical contexts. She's opening up the community side of the program to a small group of founding members, and the vision behind it is what she calls "the perpetual hallway track" — keeping that sense of connection and conversation alive between in-person events.

Andrea asked me to invite a few folks I think would be a good fit. You immediately came to mind because [**personalize: why you thought of them — a conversation you had, something they care about, how they show up in community**].

Here's the thing: she's not opening this to everyone. The first people in a community shape its culture, so she's being intentional about who's invited right now. It's not a product launch — it's more like helping to build something from the ground up.

**If this resonates, here's the page with more details and a video from Andrea:**

No pressure at all. But I wanted you to know about it because I think you'd add something valuable — and I think you'd get something valuable out of it too.

[Your name]

## Shorter Version (for text/Slack/DM)

Hey — my friend Andrea Goulet runs a program called **Debugging Human Communication** (communication coaching for people in technical contexts). She's inviting founding members into the community, and you came to mind immediately.

Her vision is to create a "perpetual hallway track" — that sense of connection we get at Agile conferences, but ongoing.

Here's the page if you're curious: [link]

No pressure — just thought you'd want to know about it.

## Notes for Champions

- **Personalize the "why you" moment** — this is the most important part. Generic invites feel like spam; specific invites feel like gifts.
- **You don't need to oversell it** — the landing page and video do that work. Your job is just to open the door.
- **Feel free to adjust the tone** to match how you normally write. This is a starting point, not a script.
