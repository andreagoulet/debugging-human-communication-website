    title: "Common Questions"
    content:
      - type: faq
        questions:
          - question: "How much time does participation require?"
            answer: "Prepare for at least 1 hour per week. You will check in a few times a week, respond to threads that resonate, and share your own experiences when relevant. Think of it like the hallway track itself — you don't need to be there every minute, but you do need to show up."
          - question: "What platform do you use?"
            answer: "We use Heartbeat, which has Slack-style channels for discussion. It's designed for community engagement rather than just chat, with features that encourage deeper conversation over quick reactions."
          - question: "What happens after the founding member period?"
            answer: "Once the community opens to the public, founding members keep their access — no fees, no expiration. Your investment is your participation in building the culture."
          - question: "Is this the same as the coaching program?"
            answer: "No. The community is part of the broader Debugging Human Communication ecosystem, but you don't need to be a coaching client to participate. The community stands on its own. If you ever want more structured guidance, group and private coaching are available separately."
          - question: "What if I need to step back for a while?"
            answer: "Life happens. If you need to take a break — for work, family, health, or just bandwidth — that's okay. Let me know, and there's no penalty. The only thing I ask is that you don't disappear without a word. When you're ready to return, you're welcome back."
          - question: "Will there be live events or just async discussion?"
            answer: "Right now, it's primarily async — threads, posts, and conversations that happen on your schedule. As the community grows, we may add optional live events like virtual coffee chats, meetup-style presentations, book clubs, etc. If you are interested in leading any live events, there are definitely opportunities to experiment."
          - question: "Can I invite others to join?"
            answer: "Not yet. During the founding member period, invitations come directly from me and the small group of people who have helped me experiment with the concept. Once we open to the public, there will be ways to refer people you think would be a good fit. For now, the focus is on building culture with a small, intentional group."
          - question: "How do you handle conflict or difficult conversations?"
            answer: "Directly and with care. This is a community about communication, so we practice what we preach and enforce our code of conduct. If you are interested in becoming a moderator, let me know."
          - question: "What topics are on/off limits?"
            answer: "We don't ban topics — we focus on how you engage. Our code of conduct restricts behaviors like character attacks, stereotyping, harassment, and discrimination, regardless of the subject matter. Sharing your lived experience — including experiences shaped by identity, background, or beliefs — is welcome here. What's not welcome is treating anyone's identity or existence as a debate topic, or using any subject as a vehicle for the restricted behaviors in our code of conduct. Before posting on sensitive subjects, ask yourself: Am I sharing from my own experience? Am I inviting conversation or shutting it down? Am I treating others' perspectives as valid even when they differ from mine? When uncertain, reach out to a moderator."
          - question: "How is this different from other Slack or Discord communities I've joined and abandoned?"
            answer: "Most online communities optimize for growth and activity metrics. This one optimizes for depth. It's smaller by design, curated intentionally, and built around genuine connection rather than content volume. The founding member model means everyone here is an active participant in making this community healthy — not just a free signup they forgot about."
          - question: "When does the community open to the public?"
            answer: "Likely by March, but there is no fixed date. The founding member period continues until we've established the culture and rhythms that make this space work. I'd rather take longer and get it right than rush to scale."
