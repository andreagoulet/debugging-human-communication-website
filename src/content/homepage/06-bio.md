title: "Meet Andrea Goulet"
intro: "Founder & Lead Coach, Debugging Human Communication"
paragraphs:
  - "Let's get one thing straight. You won't hear me tell you to \"just be more confident,\" \"smile more,\" \"maintain eye contact,\" or \"read the room.\" That advice is vague, generic, and impossible to act on — and it doesn't stick because it skips the part that actually matters: the experiment. Humans learn by testing, observing, and adjusting. My approach gives you the structure to do exactly that — and goes deep enough into the details to find what actually works."
  - "**I've spent 25 years studying the mechanics of human communication** — the patterns, structures, and systems that determine why some messages land and others don't. I've used my particular set of skills to help Fortune 500 companies navigate billion-dollar turnarounds, facilitate workshops with Smithsonian scientists, bootstrap a multi-million dollar software consultancy, and teach over 100,000 people through my courses on LinkedIn Learning."
  - "When I started sharing my ideas publicly, technologists showed up in droves. 'Finally,' they told me, 'messy human systems make sense!' Keynote invitations poured in. I launched communities and podcasts like Legacy Code Rocks and Empathy in Tech. **I became deeply embedded in the world of software — so you won't have to translate yourself into business-speak around me.**"
  - "What lights me up is diving deep into the details with an individual and finding the most elegant solution to a problem. That's what this program is built for. Not surface-level tips — real structure, real tactics, and a coach who isn't intimidated by complexity."
  - "If you've made it this far — chances are you're someone who's been wrestling with communication and knows you can figure it out with the right tools. You don't want generic advice that doesn't stick. **You want the structure, the secrets, and the tactics that actually work in your context** — and a coach who knows the difference between a stakeholder meeting and a standup."
  - "**Effective communication isn't about changing who you are. It's about having the right tools for the situation.** I've helped countless professionals find exactly that — and I'd love the chance to work with you, too."
