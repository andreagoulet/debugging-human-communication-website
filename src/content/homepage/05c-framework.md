title: "How Small Shifts Create Big Changes"
subtitle: "An experiment-driven approach to communication — designed for how analytical minds actually learn."
introText: "You don't need to overhaul your personality. You need a systematic way to find what's not working and fix it. This eight-step framework turns real conversations into a lab where you can test, observe, and iterate."
steps:
  - number: 1
    title: "Find a Friction Point"
    description: "Choose one specific challenge. Not \"get better at communication\" — something concrete, like \"my skip-level keeps interrupting me.\""
  - number: 2
    title: "Gather Context"
    description: "What conditions shape this interaction? Environment, history, power dynamics, timing. The variables matter."
  - number: 3
    title: "Identify Variables"
    description: "Name the factors you can actually influence. Your tone, your framing, when you speak, what you leave unsaid."
  - number: 4
    title: "Define Success"
    description: "What does \"better\" look like, specifically? Not \"they listen to me\" — something you can observe."
  - number: 5
    title: "Form a Hypothesis"
    description: "Predict what a small shift might change. \"If I lead with the business impact, then they'll engage with the technical details.\""
  - number: 6
    title: "Make It Measurable"
    description: "Decide how you'll know if it worked. What will you watch for? What will you write down after?"
  - number: 7
    title: "Run the Experiment"
    description: "Try it in a real conversation. One variable at a time. Record what actually happens — not what you expected."
  - number: 8
    title: "Follow What Works"
    description: "Keep what's effective. Turn surprises into new experiments. Repeat."
closingText: "This isn't theory. It's a practice — one that compounds over time."
