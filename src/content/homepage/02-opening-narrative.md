opener: "**You crack hard problems for a living. <br> So why is communicating with people so hard?**"
paragraphs:
  - "You're in a meeting, giving lots of detail to help people see your vision. Instead of the enthusiasm you were expecting, you watch everyone else's eyes glaze over."
  - "Or you're at a conference, coffee in hand, scanning the room. Everyone else seems to be connecting effortlessly. You're calculating the least awkward time to leave."
  - "Or you're at your computer, eager to share your ideas with the world — but you don't publish anything. Your brain is blocked. Somehow, you have too much to say and nothing to say — all at the same time."
painPointsIntro: "These aren't one-off events. Small miscommunications like this seem to happen every day."
painPoints:
  - "**Watching someone's eyes glaze over mid-sentence**"
  - "**Wishing you could break the ice at networking events**"
  - "**Pointing out real risks and being told you're too negative**"
  - "**Seeing funding go to half-baked ideas**"
  - "**Getting communication advice that assumes you're an extrovert**"
  - "**Feeling like everyone else knows unwritten rules you missed**"
  - "**Craving more influence but not knowing how to build it**"
  - "**Knowing you could lead more, if people knew what you were capable of**"
closingParagraphs:
  - "You've read books. Watched TED talks. Maybe sat through a corporate training full of hypotheticals that don't match your actual job."
  - "None of it stuck — because none of it matched how your brain works."
  - "What you want is a technical manual for human conversation. A debugger for communication. A way to approach these situations with the same systematic confidence you bring to technical problems."
  - "If this hits home, you've come to the right place."
