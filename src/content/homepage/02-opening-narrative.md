opener: "You know that moment."
paragraphs:
  - "You're in a meeting, explaining why the architecture decision matters, and you can see eyes glazing over. You're not wrong—you're just lost in implementation details when they wanted to hear about impact."
  - "Or you're at a conference, coffee in hand, scanning the room. Everyone else seems to be connecting effortlessly. You're calculating the least awkward time to leave."
  - "Or you're preparing for a 1:1 with your skip-level manager. You have ideas. Ambitions. But when they ask \"what do you want?\", your mind goes blank."
painPointsIntro: "Sound familiar? Maybe it's one of these:"
painPoints:
  - "You rehearse a difficult conversation for days, then say something completely different in the moment"
  - "You get feedback that you're \"too in the weeds\" but nobody explains what the right altitude looks like"
  - "You watch colleagues with half your technical skill get promoted while you're passed over"
  - "You dread the \"let's go around and introduce ourselves\" portion of any meeting"
  - "You've been told to \"build relationships\" but that feels vague and slightly manipulative"
  - "You have good ideas that die in committee because you can't get stakeholder buy-in"
  - "You avoid certain people at work because you don't know how to repair a conversation that went sideways"
closingParagraphs:
  - "You've read books. Watched TED talks. Maybe sat through a corporate training where you role-played with strangers."
  - "None of it stuck—because none of it matched how your brain works."
  - "What you want is a technical manual for human conversation. A debugger for communication. A way to approach these situations with the same systematic confidence you bring to technical problems."
  - "That's what this is."
