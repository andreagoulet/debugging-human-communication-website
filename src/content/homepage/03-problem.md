title: "It's Not a Personality Problem"
paragraphs:
  - text: "You weren't taught communication as a learnable skill."
    emphasis: "bold"
  - text: "That's the gap. Not some personal defect. Not a lack of empathy. Not being \"too logical.\""
  - text: "**You learned to code. You learned system design. You learned to debug problems by tracing them to root causes.**"
  - text: "**But communication? Was that supposed to just... happen? By osmosis?** That seems to have worked for everyone else. They somehow seemed to have intuited unwritten rules nobody explained to you."
  - text: "You watch people navigate politics, build relationships, sell their ideas, close deals, and grow their businesses in a way that seems effortless. How do they do it? How can you do it?"
  - text: "You've quietly wondered: what's the secret to communication that they know and I don't?"
    emphasis: "italic"
