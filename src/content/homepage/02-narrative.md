opener: "Crack the code to human interaction."
paragraphs:
  - "You're in a meeting, giving lots of detail to help people see your vision. Instead of the enthusiasm you were expecting, you watch everyone else's eyes glaze over."
  - "Or you're at a conference, coffee in hand, scanning the room. Everyone else seems to be connecting effortlessly. You're calculating the least awkward time to leave."
  - "Or you're pitching your company — the thing you built from scratch — and you can see the investor's attention drifting. You know the technology is solid. You know the market is there. But somehow the story isn't landing, and you can't figure out why."

closingParagraphs:
  - "You've read books. Watched TED talks. Maybe sat through a corporate training full of hypotheticals that don't match your actual job."
  - "None of it stuck — because none of it matched how your brain works."
  - "What you want is a technical manual for human conversation. A debugger for communication. A way to approach these situations with the same systematic confidence you bring to technical problems."
  - "If this hits home, you've come to the right place."
