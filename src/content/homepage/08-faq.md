title: "Common Questions"
questions:
  - question: "\"I've tried other communication training. Why would this be different?\""
    answer: "Those programs were probably designed for everyone. This one is designed for *you*—someone who thinks in systems, values evidence, and wants frameworks they can apply consistently. The methodology matches how your brain already works."
  - question: "\"I don't have time for this.\""
    answer: "This isn't additional work. It's a different approach to conversations you're already having. The time you spend stewing over an email, replaying a meeting, or avoiding a difficult conversation—that's the time this reclaims."
  - question: "\"Is it worth the investment?\""
    answer: "Consider the cost of staying stuck. Missed promotions. Stalled projects because you couldn't get buy-in. Relationships damaged by miscommunication. One successful difficult conversation can change your career trajectory. Soumya got 7 headcount during a freeze. What would that kind of result be worth to you?"
