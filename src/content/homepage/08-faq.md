title: "Common Questions"
questions:
  - question: "\"I've tried other communication training. Why would this be different?\""
    answer: "Most programs are designed for everyone, which means they're optimized for no one. This one is designed for people who think in systems, value evidence, and want frameworks they can apply consistently. The methodology matches how your brain already works."
  - question: "\"What if I don't have time for this?\""
    answer: "This isn't additional work. It's a different approach to conversations you're already having. The time you spend stewing over an email, replaying a meeting, or avoiding a difficult conversation — that's the time this reclaims."
  - question: "\"How do I know if this is worth it for me?\""
    answer: "Consider the cost of doing nothing. What's a missed promotion worth? A project that stalled because you couldn't get buy-in? A relationship with a colleague that never recovered from a misunderstanding? You're the only one who can run that math — but if communication friction is costing you more than $129, you have your answer."
  - question: "\"What's group coaching actually like?\""
    answer: "It's a small cohort of about 12 people — the same faces each week, not a rotating cast of strangers. You'll get to know each other over time, which makes it easier to share real challenges and practice in a space that feels safe. Most members find it's a relief: other analytical minds who get it, without the pressure of networking or performing."
  - question: "\"What makes private coaching different from other business coaches?\""
    answer: "Most coaches give you one session a month and send you on your way. This is a full program. You get 1:1 sessions, plus access to group coaching, plus direct async access to me between sessions when something comes up, plus the online community. I also document your frameworks and experiments so you're not starting from scratch each time. It's designed to give you the full support you need every day as you're creating and running your experiments."
  - question: "\"What's the online community like?\""
    answer: "We use a platform called Heartbeat with Slack-style channels for discussion. You'll start with an online course that sets you up for success and helps you overcome the anxiety of your initial interactions. Online courses, a resource library, and member events are all on the roadmap. Members are encouraged to share their ideas, propose changes, and explore opportunites to lead events that will foster true connection."
  - question: "\"How do I know if I'll like working with you?\""
    answer: "That's what the Discovery Session is for. It's a condensed version of a private coaching session — we'll work on a real challenge you're facing. You get a password-protected recording and the same documentation I create for my private coaching clients. It's a real sample of how we'd work together, not a sales pitch."
  - question: "\"Can I try group coaching before committing?\""
    answer: "Yes. New members can attend up to 3 group coaching calls to see if it's a good fit before signing up. You'll get a real sense of the format, the people, and whether this is right for you."
  - question: "\"What's the commitment?\""
    answer: "Community access is a one-time $129 fee and is included in your Discovery Session. — pay once and you're in for as long as the community is in operation. If for some reason you decide you don't want to take advantage of the Discovery Session, you can just pay the fee. Group coaching has a 3-month minimum, private coaching 6 months. After that, cancel anytime. Once you've paid, you keep community access even if you stop coaching. The only exception: if you request a refund after the Discovery Session, you lose access to the online community. That's it."
  - question: "\"Can I use my professional development budget?\""
    answer: "Yes. Communication skills directly impact team effectiveness, stakeholder relationships, and leadership capacity. If your company invests in training, this qualifies. Need help making the case? We can work together to craft documentation you need."
  - question: "\"What's up with the moth?\""
    answer: "In 1947, a team working on the Mark II computer couldn't figure out why the heck things weren't working as expected. After hours of searching, they decided to check deeply into the bowels of the computer and soon found the problem. A moth had made its way into the machine.\n\nIn the team's logbook, Grace Murray Hopper taped the bug to the page and commented that it was the \"first actual case of a bug found,\" and we've been fixing bugs ever since.\n\nThis story reminds us that many times the solutions to our challenges aren't always obvious. When we keep an open mind and are willing to look on the inside, that's where we can find the small and often surprising solutions that have a big impact."
  - question: "\"Can I get a discount?\""
    answer: "You read all the way to the bottom of the FAQ? That's the kind of thoroughness I appreciate. Use code READTHEFAQ for 10% off your discovery call."
