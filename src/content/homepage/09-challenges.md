title: "Effort Won't Fix Communication. Leverage Will."
epigraph:
  quote: "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."
  author: "Archimedes"
introParagraphs:
  - "Most people focus on the lever — working harder, pushing through, saying more. But Archimedes knew the real power is in the fulcrum: *where* you place it."
  - "That's what we do together. We find your tipping point — the place in your habits, timing, mindset, or messaging where a small adjustment creates outsized results."
  - "Most clients come wrestling with one of these four patterns:"
challenges:
  - title: "Conversation Flow"
    description: "You know what you want to say, but it comes out wrong. You rehearse for days, then freeze in the moment. You replay conversations wondering what you should have said differently."
    tip: "Stock your toolkit with curious questions: 'Help me understand...' 'What's driving that?' 'What would change your mind?' Use them when words fail you."
  - title: "Stakeholder Buy-In"
    description: "You have good ideas, but you can't get traction. Whether it's a boardroom, an investor meeting, or an internal proposal — you're told you're \"too in the weeds\" but nobody explains what the right altitude looks like. The people who should be your biggest advocates aren't buying what you're selling."
    tip: "Before your next pitch, proposal, or board update, ask yourself: \"What problem does this solve that *they* already care about?\" Lead with their problem, not your solution."
  - title: "Community & Belonging"
    description: "You feel like you don't fit in anywhere. Networking feels performative and draining. You're tired of code-switching just to connect, and wonder if there's a place where you can just be yourself."
    tip: "Watch for people who smile, nod, or make eye contact — they're signaling openness. Mirror it back. That small exchange is often all it takes to start a real conversation."
  - title: "Growth & Leadership"
    description: "You're ready to do more — whether that's leading a team, running a company, or sharing your ideas to a bigger audience. You want to grow without faking a personality that isn't yours."
    tip: "Think of a peer or mentor who's navigated a similar transition. Send them a short note. The conversations that reshape your leadership often start with a simple 'I'd love to pick your brain.'"
closingText: "Ready to find your leverage point?"
