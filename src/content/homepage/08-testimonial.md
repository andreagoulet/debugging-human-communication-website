title: "Real Results from Real Engineers"
testimonial:
  quote: "<p>When I shifted from engineer to entrepreneur, I was terrified. The thought of going to business events and pitching was a huge blocker. Andrea helped me figure out why, and it was the weirdest thing — my clothes.</p><br><p>I thought I had to wear polos, button down shirts, and khakis to be seen as \"professional.\" But I hated wearing them. I'd always felt most comfortable and relaxed in my jeans, geeky graphic tee, and sneakers.</p><br><p>Andrea suggested I experiment with wearing what I liked but swinging by a thrift store before my next event to pick up a cheap sports coat to elevate my look. I was super skeptical, but game for giving it a try.</p><br><p>I had no idea how powerful that small change would be. My confidence soared and I started making sales, introducing myself to strangers, and speaking at conferences. All that from an $8 sports coat? That tiny experiment and tiny investment completely changed my career.</p>"
