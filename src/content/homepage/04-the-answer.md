title: "Communication Is a System. Reverse Engineer It."
paragraphs:
  - text: "Communication is a system. It can be analyzed, understood, and systematically improved."
    emphasis: "bold"
  - text: "When a conversation goes wrong, there's a reason. And like any system, you can form a hypothesis, test an approach, and iterate based on what you learn."
  - text: "That's how you already work. You don't expect code to be perfect on the first try. You ship, observe, adjust."
  - text: "Debugging Human Communication applies that same experimental mindset to conversations. Try something. See what happens. Refine your approach. Get better over time—not through abstract theory, but through real practice with real feedback."
