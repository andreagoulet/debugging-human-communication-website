  - title: "Decode the Hidden Systems that Underpin Human Interaction"
    paragraphs:
      - "Communication has patterns, principles, structures—but nobody taught you what they are. You've been trying to navigate without a map."
      - "Once you understand how conversations actually work—why some land and others don't, what's really happening when someone gets defensive, how influence actually builds—things click into place."
    testimonial:
      quote: "I finally feel like I have patterns and structures to understand conversations, not just random advice that doesn't fit how I think. Andrea's approach treats communication like the learnable skill it is."
      author: "Lada Kesseler"
  - title: "Design Easy-to-Implement Experiments for Rapid Results"
    paragraphs:
      - "Understanding isn't enough. You also need an approach you can actually execute."
      - "Instead of forcing yourself into someone else's system, we design experiments around what you're already doing. The goal: find the smallest tweak that creates disproportionate results."
    testimonial:
      quote: "You spotted assumptions I didn't even know I had. This experiment seems so easy and I can already see how impactful it will be."
      author: "Client on designing experiments"
  - title: "Develop Your Skills with Expert Guidance"
    paragraphs:
      - "You won't get handed a one-size-fits-all playbook. Instead, you'll work with a guide who understands the nuance of human systems and can help you design experiments to discover what actually works for you."
      - "Think of it as co-creation: I bring the structure, accountability, and deep expertise — you bring your context and curiosity. Together, we'll navigate the complexity and arrive at solutions that fit your life."
    testimonial:
      quote: "She sees what I can't see on my own, and helps me build a mental model for whatever I'm facing. What felt chaotic suddenly has structure."

  - title: "Discover the Transformative Power of Community Learning"
    paragraphs:
      - "You've probably felt it—the loneliness of being the person who communicates differently. The code-switching. The holding back. The quiet embarrassment of not navigating social situations the way your colleagues seem to."
      - "In this community, you don't have to translate yourself. You can think out loud in detail and schematics. You can be direct without apology."
      - "And you'll discover you're not alone. Others are working through the same challenges—and they're eager to share what's working. Members swap experiments like recipes, excited to let each other in on what they've found."
    testimonial:
      quote: "After working with Andrea, I went to a conference and actually enjoyed meeting people. I had a framework for starting conversations and knew how to exit gracefully when needed."
