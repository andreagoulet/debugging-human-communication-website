title: "Your Communication Upgrade Starts Here"
intro: "Imagine walking into your next difficult conversation knowing exactly what to try. Not hoping it goes well — but having a hypothesis to test and a framework for learning from whatever happens."
paragraphs:
  - text: "That's what this work makes possible. Not perfection — progress. Not scripts — understanding. Not becoming someone else — becoming more effective as yourself."
  - text: "Your analytical mind is an asset here, not an obstacle."
    emphasis: "bold"
  - text: "You already know how to debug systems, run experiments, and iterate toward better solutions. Communication works the same way once you have the right framework. And the people who've done this work? They're landing promotions, closing funding rounds, building stronger teams, and finally feeling confident in rooms that used to make them want to disappear."
closing: "One experiment at a time. That's all it takes to start."
ctaText: "Book Your Discovery Session →"
ctaSubtext: "$129 for 30 minutes of focused work on your specific challenge. You'll leave with a concrete experiment to run — and if you don't find it valuable, you get a full refund."
