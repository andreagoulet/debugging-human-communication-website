title: "Find Your Lever"
epigraph:
  quote: "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."
  author: "Archimedes"
introParagraphs:
  - "Most people focus on the lever — working harder, doing more. But the real power is in the fulcrum: *where* you place it."
  - "That's what we do together. We find your tipping point — the place in your habits, schedule, mindset, or messaging where a small shift creates outsized results."
  - "Most clients come wrestling with one of these four challenges — and leave with small shifts that made a big impact."
challenges:
  - title: "Conversation Flow"
    description: "You know what you want to say, but it comes out wrong. You rehearse for days, then freeze in the moment. You replay conversations wondering what you should have said differently."
    tip: "Before your next difficult conversation, write down what you want the other person to *feel* when it's over — not what you want to say. Let that guide your words."
  - title: "Stakeholder Buy-In"
    description: "You have good ideas, but you can't get traction. You're told you're \"too in the weeds\" but nobody explains what the right altitude looks like. Your proposals die in committee."
    tip: "Before your next proposal, ask yourself: \"What problem does this solve that they already care about?\" Lead with that, not the solution."
  - title: "Community & Belonging"
    description: "You feel like you don't fit in anywhere. Networking feels performative. You're tired of code-switching just to connect with colleagues."
    tip: "At your next event, forget \"working the room.\" Set a goal of having one genuine conversation. Give yourself permission to leave after that."
  - title: "Career Growth"
    description: "You keep getting passed over and you don't know why. You're told to \"be more visible\" but self-promotion feels gross. You want to grow without playing games."
    tip: "Next time you finish something you're proud of, share what you learned — not what you accomplished. It feels less like bragging."
closingText: "Ready to find your lever?"
