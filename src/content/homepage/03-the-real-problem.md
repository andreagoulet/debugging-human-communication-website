title: "It's Not a Personality Problem"
paragraphs:
  - text: "You weren't taught communication as a learnable skill."
    emphasis: "bold"
  - text: "That's the gap. Not some personality defect. Not a lack of empathy. Not being \"too logical.\""
  - text: "You learned to code. You learned system design. You learned to debug problems by tracing them to root causes."
  - text: "But communication? That was supposed to just... happen. Osmosis. Watching how other people do it. Picking up on unwritten rules nobody explained."
  - text: "Some people did pick it up. You've watched them navigate politics, build relationships, get promoted."
  - text: "And you've quietly wondered: What do they know that I don't?"
    emphasis: "italic"
