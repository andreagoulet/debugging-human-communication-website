## Email Body

Hey [Name],

I've been thinking about you.

You know how at Agile conferences and Open Spaces — or really any gathering of our people — the best part is the hallway conversations. Those moments when you're talking with someone who *gets it* and suddenly the ideas are flowing and you remember why you love this work.

And then the conference ends and everyone goes home and... that feeling slowly fades.

**I've been part of a community experiment to try to keep the Agile magic alive year round, and I think you'd like it, too.**

It's an online community run by my friend, Andrea Goulet. She's a communication coach for people who are craving a technical manual for human conversation and runs a program called **Debugging Human Communication**. (She's also one of the founders of Legacy Code Rocks.) 

For the past several months, she's been working with a small group of us to see if her vision for the community part of the program could also be used to replicate the experience of a "perpetual hallway track." 

I have to say...she's on to something. She found a new platform called Heartbeat that's like Slack or Discord, but it's designed for community engagement and not just chat. I've gotten a lot of value from participating so far. 

The next step in the community-building process is developing the culture with intention. So Andrea is building a group of 30 founding members and asked us to invite a few people in our network who we'd want to be part of it. 

You immediately came to mind because [**personalize: why you thought of them — a conversation you had, something they care about, how they show up in community**].

The commitment is active participation — posting and replying to other people's posts — for at least 6 months. The idea is that the first people in a community shape the culture, which we want to be grounded in healthy communication and psychological safety. 

In return, founding members will get lifetime access to the community (which will be $129 when it opens to the public) and a complimentary 30-minute private coaching session with Andrea.

I have to say, I really respect how she's using the "go well to go fast" philosophy as she builds this out. 

**If helping to build out this community resonates, here's where you can get more details:**

No pressure at all. But I wanted you to know about it because I think you'd add something valuable — and I think you'd get something valuable out of it too.

[Your name]

## Shorter Version (for text/Slack/DM)

Hey — my friend Andrea Goulet runs a program called **Debugging Human Communication** (communication coaching for people who are craving a technical manual for human conversations — she also founded Legacy Code Rocks). I've been part of a small group helping her shape the community, and now she's inviting 30 founding members. You came to mind immediately.

Her vision is to create a "perpetual hallway track" — that sense of connection we get at Agile conferences and Open Spaces, but ongoing. Founding members commit to 6 months of active participation; in return you get lifetime access and a free coaching session with Andrea.

Here's the page if you're curious: (https://www.debugginghumancommunication.com/hallway-track)

No pressure — just thought you'd want to know about it.

## Notes for Champions

- **Personalize the "why you" moment** — this is the most important part. Generic invites feel like spam; specific invites feel like gifts.
- **You don't need to oversell it** — the landing page and video do that work. Your job is just to open the door.
- **Feel free to adjust the tone** to match how you normally write. This is a starting point, not a script.
