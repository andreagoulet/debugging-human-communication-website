## Script

Hi! I'm Andrea Goulet.

I'm a communication coach, and I recently launched a program called Debugging Human Communication. It's for people who are craving a technical manual for human conversation.

If you're watching this, you also care about the humans who work in technical systems — 

not just the code, not just the architecture, not just the processes or methodologies — but the people. 

How do I know? Because someone I trust saw that in you and thought you should be here.

**[pause]**

An essential part of this program is a thriving community — 

and that's what you're being invited into as a founding member.

**[pause]**

If you choose to become a founding member, you'll have access to the online community — 

a space for ongoing conversation and connection. 

It's hosted on a platform called Heartbeat which has a similar interface to Slack.

**[pause]**

You'll alo get a private Discovery Session with me: a 30-minute version of my private coaching sessions. 

I'm offering these at no charge to founding members as a way of saying thank you for helping shape what this becomes.

Because that's the exchange. The first people in any community set the tone and create the culture. 

**[pause]**

As one of 30 founding members, you commit to active participation in the online community by regularly posting your ideas, experiences, and expertise — 

and showing up for others by offering support, sharing resources, and modeling psychological safety.

If that sounds like something you'd do anyway — then check out the details below. 

If it sounds interesting, but you have constraints where active contribution isn't realistic, 

please politely decline to make space for another person who can. 

**[warm smile]**

I'm really grateful you're here, and regardless of whether or not you decide to join, 

thanks for all the work you do to ensure that human connection remains at the core of how businesses operate.
