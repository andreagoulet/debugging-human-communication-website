## Script

Hi! I'm Andrea Goulet.

You know that feeling at Agile conferences and Open Spaces? You walk in and it's like a family reunion.

Between the hugs, you're overwhelmed with gratitude — because you're surrounded by people who share your passion for human-centered work.

And while the sessions are great, what you really look forward to is the hallway track. Those unstructured conversations where the real connection happens.

Then the conference ends. Everyone goes home. And slowly, that spark fades.

**[pause]**

This community exists to keep that hallway track magic alive year-round.

I started Debugging Human Communication as a coaching program for people who are craving a technical manual for human conversation. And an essential part of that is a thriving community — which is what you're being invited into as a founding member.

**[pause]**

Before the community opens to the public, it's important to build the right culture. The first people in any community set the tone — and that's why you're receiving this invitation. You're someone who naturally embodies what this space is striving for.

**[pause]**

We've been experimenting with a small group for about three months now, and we're ready to grow to 30 founding members. You're someone we respect and believe would add immense value, so we hope you consider joining as a founding member.

Here's what that would look like: 

Actively participate in the online community for at least 6 months by regularly posting your ideas, experiences, and expertise, and showing up for others by offering support and modeling psychological safety. You can estimate a time commitment of about an hour a week.

**[pause]**

In return, you'd get lifetime access to the community — which will be $129 when it launches publicly — and a complimentary 30-minute private coaching session with me. It's my way of saying thank you for helping shape what this becomes.

**[pause]**

If that sounds like something you'd do anyway — we'd love to have you. Check out the details below.

And if the timing or fit isn't right, that's completely okay. There's no pressure here.

**[warm smile]**

I'm really grateful you're here, and regardless of whether or not you decide to join, thanks for all the work you do to keep human connection at the core of how we build software together.
